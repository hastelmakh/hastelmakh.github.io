                <div class="description">
                    When I joined Byrd, the company was in the midst of scaling its digital products. There was a
                    challenge — no unified design system that could ensure consistency across all platforms. My
                    colleague, <strong>Vedran Jukić</strong> had already kickstarted the process by laying the
                    foundation, but it needed refining and expanding. This was where I came in. Together, we embarked
                    on the journey to create a seamless, cohesive design system for Byrd’s ever-growing product suite.
